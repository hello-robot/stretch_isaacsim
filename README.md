# stretch IsaacSim

This repository adds preliminary support for Stretch on Isaac Sim.

## Usage

To use Stretch in Isaac Sim, simply use MJCF Importer and import `models/stretch.xml` into your simulation. To open MJCF Importer, navigate to `Isaac Utils -> Workflows -> MJCF Importer`. Or alternatively, you can directly use `models/stretch.usd`. Note that support for base lidar is a work in progress.
